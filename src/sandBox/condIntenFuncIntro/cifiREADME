(c)onditional (i)intenstiy (f)unction (i)ntroduction README (cifiREAME)

DESCRIPTION

    One of the main things we have to do for the reinforcement learning algorithm, is train conditional intensity
    functions. These are used to judge novelty, and guide synaptice weight updates! Here we will first demonstarte this
    this in a simple example.

FILES AND FOLDERS

    We will have a set of files that each do important tasks

    condIntenFunc_0_0 : this will have functions in it to generate spike times inputs

    condIntenFunc_0_3 : has functions and classes needed to calculate and learn the conditional intensity functions
