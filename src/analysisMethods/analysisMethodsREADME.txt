README for folder analysisMethods

DESCRIPTION

    All the primary analysis methods and operations will be here stored within this folder. These will be as generic as
    possible to make them most applicable

FILES AND FOLDERS

    (1) cifAnalysisMethods.py
        This python file has methods specficially for analysis of conditional intensity functions. More generally these
        methods can include methods to quantize and measure the functional performance of the CIF to predict and capture
        network dynamics as well as methods to to qantize computational complexity.
