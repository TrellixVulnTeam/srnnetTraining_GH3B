DESCRIPTION
Here we will have examples of how we can store networks and data some network has produced.

EXAMPLE 1: savingData_0_0.py
    Here we simply run a simulation, and use python's pickle module to save the data recorded from the brian2's
    "StateMonitor" class. We also demonstarate how we can save the the original units of the recorded data.
