Shanel's TODO list

(1) Create method/function to analzye spike counts as in (Lazar et al. 2009)
    Task Description
        In particular we are concerned with comparing long periods of time, as shown in Figure. 5, plot B. Develop your
        methods in one file, and call them from a second file to work on some test data. Do this in the
        sandbox/analysisFunctionDevelopment/ folder.

    Task Update (SCP):
        Function was completed (SpikeCount) and is in the sandBox with an accompanying tester script (SpikeCountTest)
    Task Update (SCP):
        An additional function was added (SpikeCount2D) in order to accept 2D time inputs (spike times for multiple
        neurons)

(2) Create PCA algorithm to quantify variance in the network (Lazar et al. 2009)
    Task Description
        Algorithm should output the variance proportion on each principal component and a figure like Lazar fig.3H should
        be able to be constructed in main body of code
