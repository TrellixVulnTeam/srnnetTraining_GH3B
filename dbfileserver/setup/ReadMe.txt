I installed mongodb for 64 bit windows from here:

	https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#enterprise

I then followed the directions from here:

	https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

and installed mongodb as a service on windows. I specified the configuration
file and the mongodb path as part of the installation (will not share the locations
for security purposes on source control).

I then followed the directions from here:

	https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/installation.html

to install pymongo (I have pip and probably you do to! To check, type "pip" into the command line
and see if the output tells you how to use pip).
