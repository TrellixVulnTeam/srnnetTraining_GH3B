(1) GIT and which code to upload

    (1.A) Make sure to ignore certian files using the .gitignre file. In the least include the following lines,
          .idea/*
          *.pyc
          .gitignore

    (1.B) Do not include compiled code. When you compile a standalone brian2 file, it will generate cpp files, make sure
          not to include these files.
