README for folder Specific Aim 1, Part 1, Test Protocal 1, the experiments within are described within the word document
"ALons_Research_AimOne_Part_1_1_DRAFT_RXXX". These experiments are meant to examine the robustness of the CIF approach.

DESCRIPTION

    Here in this folder are the necessary to run the desired experiments, and store all the resultant data.

OUTLINE OF WORK HERE STORED

    (1) Neural Simulation: Data Creation
    In order to test the feasibility of the CIFS to learn, we have to create data for them to learn upon. In this first
    step we generate all the network data that they will need.

    (1.A) Simulate Data Generators
    We first have to create data from the "data generators" which will then be later transferred into spike trains.

FILES AND FOLDERS

    (1) __init__.py
    This is so python can see what is within this folder

    (2) movingPointMassData/
    This folder will have data for a point mass moving randomly across some domain.
