README for folder dataGenerators

DESCRIPTION

    Here in this folder are the necessary classes and functions necessary to create and store data that will be used
    to train and test networks. The output of these methods will be numpy arrays (or lists) of the appropriate
    dimension. See each python file and methods for specific details. 

FILES AND FOLDERS

    (2) movingPointMass1D.py
        This python file/module has methods to generate movements of a 1D point mass.
