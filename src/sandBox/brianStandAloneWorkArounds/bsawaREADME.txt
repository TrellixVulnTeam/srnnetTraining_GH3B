DESCRIPTION
One major problem using brian is that the wonderful standalone complilation option does not work for loops. That is if
one would like to simulate repeatedly, with different parameter values, you have to recompile every time. Also there
are some special things you must do even in this situation.

To make things more complicated is the introduction of parallel procesinng.

The files included in here show ways to get around these potential problems
