This is the database side of srnnetTraining

We are using MongoDB community version for 64 bit Windows
to store all data generated from simulations.

This directory houses a python module that is used to manage
database activity such as posting, querying, updating, etc.

The command to start MongoDB on windows is:

    net start MongoDB

this command can be  used to check that MongoDB is running.
